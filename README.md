# Disease-prediction-system-from-symptoms-in-Humans
This project provides a system to predict diseases based on user-input symptoms using machine learning algorithms. We have implemented Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes algorithms for accurate predictions. The application features a user-friendly graphical interface built with Tkinter.

**Features**
Multi-Algorithm Predictions: Uses Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes algorithms to predict diseases based on symptoms.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive interface built with Tkinter for easy input and interaction.
Accurate Predictions: Provides reliable predictions based on a trained machine learning model.
Educational Resource: Can be used for educational purposes to understand the application of machine learning in healthcare.

**Requirements:**
Python 3.x ,
scikit-learn ,
pandas ,
numpy ,
Tkinter (comes pre-installed with Python).

1.Run the main application
2.Interact with the application:
    -The Tkinter interface will open, allowing you to input symptoms.
    -Select symptoms from the provided options and click the "Predict" button to get the predicted disease.
