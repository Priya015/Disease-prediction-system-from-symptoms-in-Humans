# Disease-prediction-system-from-symptoms-in-Humans
This project provides a system to predict diseases based on user-input symptoms using machine learning algorithms. We have implemented Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes algorithms for accurate predictions. The application features a user-friendly graphical interface built with Tkinter.
